### 3. Description

The `ratelimit` package implements a service with rate limiting functionality.

For simplicity, 
1. `ratelimit` server uses in-memory data structure to keep track of the number of requests each user made within 60 second.
2. HTTP server directly serves all incoming HTTP traffic to port `8080`, i.e., no routing. 


#### `RateLimitHandler`

`RateLimitHandler` is the struct that handles the request. It implements `ServeHTTP` so that it can be passed to `http.Server` as a `http.Handler`.

It also has fields `limit` and `window`, both default to `60` (second). Representing the limit of number of request, the time interval which the number of request should be count, respectively.

```go
// RateLimitHandler implement ServeHTTP,
// handles the incoming request and performs rate limiting.
type RateLimitHandler struct {
	records map[string]*Record
	limit   int
	window  int
}
```

Inside the `RateLimitHandler`, a hashmap `records` is used to record the timestamp of each user's request.

```go
// Record stores the request's timestamp corresponding to a certain IP.
type Record struct {
	mtx       sync.Mutex
	timestamp []int64
}
```

Every time a request comes in, `RateLimitHandler` will check if this IP address exists in `records`. If not, initialize a `Record` for this IP.

Then `RateLimitHandler` will try to add a timestamp to the `Record`'s `timestamp` array by calling `Record`'s `Add` method.

`func Record.Add(limit, window int) (int, error)` will first aquire a lock to make sure the below operation is thread-safe. Noted that the lock is in `Record` level, meaning that request from different IP will not be blocked.

After that, it then calculate the start time `start`, which is the unix timestamp of `window` second before now. And find the first value in `timestamp` that is greater than `start` by binary search.

Now `Record` will know how many request is made within the past `window` second. If it exceeds `limit`, return an error. Else, return the number of request within `window` second + 1 (the current request).

On the other hand, the records that are before `start` are no longer needed, `timestamp` will be sliced to save space.
